We responded with a counterattack, slicing through their backline, but our final shot ricocheted off the post and out</p>

                            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.6s">It was a day packed with passion, pressure, and pure football magic as our U16 squad took to the field against our long-standing local rivals. From the very first whistle, the intensity was palpable — both teams fighting for every inch of the pitch with relentless energy. Our boys came out with a bold 4-3-3 setup, showing attacking intent from the start. Despite an early goal from the opposition, our team remained composed, and by the 25th minute, a clever through ball found our striker who coolly slotted the equalizer into the bottom corner. The atmosphere in the stands was electric, as fans rallied behind every move.</p>

In the 68th minute, the rivals capitalized on a defensive lapse drawing level at 2-2. Tension soared as both sides pressed for the winner, each attack more intense than the last. But our team's resilience and fitness began to shine through in the final 10 minutes.</p>
